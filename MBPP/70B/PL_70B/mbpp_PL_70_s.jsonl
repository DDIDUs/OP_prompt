Find the first occurrence of `ch`: Use the `index()` method to find the index of the first occurrence of `ch` in `s`. If `ch` is not found, `index()` will raise a `ValueError`.\n\n4. Find the last occurrence of `ch`: Use the `rfind()` method to find the index of the last occurrence of `ch` in `s`. If `ch` is not found, `rfind()` will return -1.\n\n5.

Pancake Sorting is a variation of the sorting algorithms that involves flipping the elements of the array. In each step, we choose the maximum element from the unsorted part of the array and flip it to the beginning of the array. Then, we flip the maximum element to its correct position.\n\n5. We can implement the Pancake Sorting algorithm to solve this problem. We will need to iterate over the array multiple times, and in each iteration, we will find the maximum element in the unsorted part of the array, flip it to the beginning, and then flip it to its correct position.\n\n6. Once the entire array is sorted, we can return the sorted array as the result.\n\nNote: The Pancake Sorting algorithm has a high time complexity (O(n^2)), so it's not efficient for large lists. However, since the problem doesn't specify any constraints on efficiency, we can implement this algorithm as per the problem statement"}

Think about the approach:\n   - We can use a loop to generate the first 'n' even natural numbers.\n   - In each iteration, we can calculate the cube of the current number and add it to the total sum.\n   - We can use the unit test `assert cube_Sum(2) == 72` to validate our function.\n\n5. Prepare to write the solution:\n   - We will write a function `cube_Sum(n)` that takes an integer 'n' as input.\n   - Inside the function, we will initialize a variable to store the sum of cubes.\n   - We will then use a loop to generate the first 'n' even natural numbers, calculate their cubes, and add them to the sum.\n   - Finally, we will return the sum.\n"}

Understand the problem: The problem is asking to write a function that takes an integer as input and toggles all its bits except the first and the last bit.\n\n2. Identify the requirements: The function should take an integer as input, toggle the middle bits (all bits except the first and the last), and return the resulting integer.\n\n3.

Think about the approach: One possible approach is to use bitwise operations to achieve this. We can create a mask to isolate the middle bits, toggle them using the XOR operation, and then combine the result with the original number.\n\n5. Consider edge cases: We need to handle cases where the input number has only one or two bits. In such cases, there are no middle bits to toggle, so the function should return the input number as it is.\n"}
