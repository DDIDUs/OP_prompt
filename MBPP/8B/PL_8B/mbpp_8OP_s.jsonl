The formula for the perimeter of a polygon is P = n * s, where P is the perimeter, n is the number of sides, and s is the length of each side.\n\nIn this case, since the pentagon is regular, n = 5. Therefore, the formula becomes P = 5 * s.\n\nOur function should take one parameter, s, which is the length of the side of the pentagon, and return 5 * s.\n\nThe function will be named 'perimeter_pentagon' and will take an integer as input.

This means that each element in the sequence must be at least twice the previous one, which gives us a lower bound for the possible values. On the other hand, the upper bound is given by m.\n\nWe can start by thinking about the first element in the sequence. It can take any value from 1 to m, since it's the starting point and has no constraint from the previous element. Let's call this value x.\n\nFor the second element, we know it must be at least twice the first element (x), so its possible range is [x, m]. Now, for the third element, it must be at least twice the second element, so its range is [2*x, m]. Continuing this process, we can see that each subsequent element's range depends on the previous one.\n\nWe can model this as a recursive function, where the range for each element depends on the previous element. The base case would be when we've reached the end of the sequence (i.e., n elements). At this point, we simply return the number of possible values in the final range, which would be m - 2^(n-1) + 1 (since the lower bound is 2^(n-1)).\n\nFor each previous element, we would recursively calculate the number of possible values in its range and multiply it by the number of possible values in the next range.

This means we need to find sequences of length n where the first half and second half have the same sum of bits.\n\nFor each sequence of length n, we have two options for the first bit: 0 and 1. If the first bit is 0, the sum of bits in the first half will be equal to the sum of bits in the second half if and only if the sum of bits in the second half is n. Similarly, if the first bit is 1, the sum of bits in the first half will be equal to the sum of bits in the second half if and only if the sum of bits in the second half is n - 1.\n\nThis means that for each sequence of length n, we need to find the number of ways to get a sum of n and n - 1 using n bits. This is a well-known problem in combinatorics, which can be solved using the binomial coefficient.\n\nSo, the total count of sequences will be the sum of the number of ways to get a sum of n and n - 1 using n bits, which is 2 * choose(n, n/2).\n\nIn Python, this can be implemented as follows:\n\ncount_binary_seq = lambda n: 2 ** n // 2 ** (n // 2)\n\nThis solution assumes that n is even, as otherwise, there would not be any valid sequences"}

First, we will define the base case when n is 1. In this case, there are only two possible binary sequences (00 and 11) and both of them satisfy the condition. So, the count is 2.\n\n2. For n > 1, we can use dynamic programming to solve the problem. We will maintain a 2D array dp where dp[i][j] represents the count of binary sequences of length 2i where the sum of first i bits is j.\n\n3. For each i from 1 to n, we can form a binary sequence of length 2i by appending either 0 or 1 to a binary sequence of length 2(i-1). If the current sequence has sum j, then it can be extended to have sum j+1 by appending 1 to the end, and it can also be extended to have sum j-1 by appending 0 to the end.\n\n4. Therefore, the total count of binary sequences of length 2i with sum j is the sum of the counts of sequences of length 2(i-1) with sum j-1 and sum j.\n\n5.

{"task_id": "Mbpp/300", "completion": "\nThe problem asks to find the count of all binary sequences of length 2n where the sum of the first 'n' bits is equal to the sum of the last 'n' bits.\n\nThe first step is to understand what a binary sequence of length 2n looks like. It will be a string of 2n characters consisting of only 0's and 1's.\n\nThe second step is to understand what is meant by \"the sum of the first n bits\" and \"the sum of the last n bits\". The sum of the first n bits means the sum of the first 'n' characters of the binary sequence, which can be calculated by iterating over the first 'n' characters and adding 1 if the character is 1 and 0 otherwise. Similarly, the sum of the last n bits means the sum of the last 'n' characters of the binary sequence.\n\nThe third step is to find the count of these sequences. For this, we need to consider all possible combinations of the first 'n' bits and the last 'n' bits. Since each bit can be either 0 or 1, there are 2 possible combinations for each bit. Therefore, the total number of combinations is 2^n.\n\nHowever, not all combinations satisfy the condition that the sum of the first 'n' bits is equal to the sum of the last 'n' bits. For example, if the first 'n' bits sum up to 'x', then the last 'n' bits must also sum up to 'x' for the condition to hold.\n\nTo solve this problem, we can generate all possible combinations of the first 'n' bits and the last 'n' bits, calculate the sum of the first 'n' bits and the sum of the last 'n' bits for each combination, and count the number of combinations that satisfy the condition.\n\nThis problem can be solved using Python programming language. We can use recursion to generate all possible combinations of the first 'n' bits and the last 'n' bits, and then calculate the sum of the first 'n' bits and the sum of the last 'n' bits for each combination. We can use a dictionary to keep track of the count of combinations that satisfy the condition.\n\nFinally, we can return the count of combinations that satisfy the condition as the result"}

Convert the input integer into a string to easily access its digits.\n2. Initialize a variable to store the sum of the cubes of the digits.\n3. Iterate over each digit in the string.\n4.

If it is, then the number is an Armstrong number and the function returns True. Otherwise, it returns False.\n\nBy following these steps, I can create a function that correctly identifies whether a given number is an Armstrong number or not"}
